LinkedIn:
You may create LinkedIn test profiles to test your Application, provided that they do not interact with real Members or company or other organization pages on LinkedIn.
2.3   Test Profiles (LinkedIn API Terms Of Use):
You may create up to five test LinkedIn profiles for purposes of testing your Application only. You must create the profiles manually and not via automated means, such as scripts.
Test profiles must: (a) be standard LinkedIn member profiles; (b) not interact with non-test profiles (for example, you cannot use test accounts to comment on posts and you cannot connect test profiles with non-test profiles, such as your own personal LinkedIn profile); and (c) not override our API call limits.  You must clearly identify the profiles as test profiles, and you must identify these additional account profiles as “developers” in your Application registration. You may not create any profile positions at real companies (besides your own) for the test profiles.
